# movie-project
a project where we can add and filter movies with local storage javascript

I created this project with object-oriented programming in JavaScript and modularization logic <br>
There are 4 modules in this projects: film, ui, storage and project <br>
Project module is a main module. Includes the main functions, create objects from other modules and recall all functions. <br>
Storage module includes all storage operations. <br>
UI module is the modul where all received data transfering to the interface. <br>
And film module is only includes the Film constructor. We can need this module if we want to add a new attribute or update an attribute to Film object.  <br>
